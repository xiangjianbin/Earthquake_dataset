# Earthquake_dataset
A dataset was created based on all moderate and strong earthquakes (1,596) in the Sichuan-Yunnan region in the past 20 years. It collected data on historical earthquake catalogs, gravity, faults, crustal velocity, crustal thickness, Moho depth, lithology, and groundwater within a certain spatial range centered on the earthquake source.
